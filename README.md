# DSR_Project1
Repository for the first project in the Data Storage and Retrieval class. Fall 2017.

~~Deadline is October 31st (or 3 weeks, roughly). Please post any ideas you have at https://github.com/acastrops/DSR_Project1/issues/1 :)~~

* 2017-10-12: Created a basic flask/skeleton framework that can connect to the remote (currently empty) database. Shared the secrets file on Google Drive, which goes in '<project root>/h1b/'. Run `python package_and_run.py` to package the app and start the server. After it's packaged you can just do `flask run`.
